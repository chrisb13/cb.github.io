The following is some code I've writen or contributed to, all on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/chrisb13):

 * [mkmov](http://www.github.com/chrisb13/mkmov) is designed to make a movie from a NetCDF file or stitch together a series of *.png files. Interface is by command line and everything is done in one line! [Documentation is here](http://christopherbull.com.au/mkmov).

 * [eddytracking](http://www.github.com/chrisb13/eddytracking) is a  Chelton et al. (Prog. Ocean., 2011) style, eddy tracking package I contributed to. Originally written by [Eric Oliver](http://www.github.com/ecjoliver/eddytracking).
	
 * [MkPaper](http://www.github.com/chrisb13/mkpaper) creates a figure document in 3 + n lines of code, where n is the number of figures you have! Check out the blog post I wrote on it [here](http://christopherbull.com.au/python/programmatic-paper-mkpaper/).
