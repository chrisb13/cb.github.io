## I am ...
A PhD candidate studying physical oceanography at the [University of New South Wales](http://www.unsw.edu.au).


## Interested in ...
Chris is interested in the ocean circulation around Australia. In particular, the Pacific to Indian inter-ocean exchange. Using [Lagrangian techniques](https://code.google.com/p/connectivity-modeling-system/), Chris' PhD focuses on how Australia’s boundary currents are connected, under what mechanisms/timescales they vary and how their circulation will change in the future.

PhD supervisors: [Erik van Sebille](http://www.erik.vansebille.com/science/) and [Matthew England](http://web.science.unsw.edu.au/~matthew/).
