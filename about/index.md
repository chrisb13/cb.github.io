## I am ...
A post-doc studying ocean ice-shelf interactions around Antarctica at the [British Antarctic Survey](http://www.bas.ac.uk).

## Interested in ...
Chris is interested in ocean ice-shelf interactions and Australia's boundary currents. Chris is working with [Adrian Jenkins](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/ajen/) at the British Antarctic Survey, we are interested in improving the numerical representation of the processes and dynamics associated with the Filchner Ice Shelf system in the Weddell Sea. Chris' PhD focused on how Australia’s boundary currents are connected, under what mechanisms/timescales they vary and how their circulation could be explained in the future.
