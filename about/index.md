## I am ...
A faculty member [Northumbria University](https://research.northumbria.ac.uk/coldandpalaeo/) within the research peak [The Future of Ice on Earth](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/research/1/our-peaks-of-excellence/the-future-of-ice-on-earth/), interested in the ocean circulation as it relates to Antarctica's ice shelves. 

Chris studies Antarctic ocean ice-shelf interactions using numerical models as a tool to improve our understanding of observed or modelled phenomena. Chris is working with [David Munday](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/danday/) and Prof [Adrian Jenkins](https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/researchers/adrian-jenkins(36b8a5bd-7f4d-4455-ae66-c09f899e8558).html) in the European Horizon 2020 research project [TiPACC](https://www.tipaccs.eu/). 

The overall aim of TiPACCs is to assess the likelihood of large and abrupt near-future changes in the contribution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to global sea level, caused by tipping points in the Antarctic continental shelf seas and the Antarctic Ice Sheet. We are interested in improving our understanding of the dynamics associated with an ‘Ocean Tipping Point’ or the possibility of the Antarctic continental shelf seas changing from cold to warm states. Here's a TiPACCs primer:

[Chris’ PhD at UNSW](https://www.unsworks.unsw.edu.au/permalink/f/5gm2j3/unsworks_51220) (Australia) focused on how Australia’s boundary currents are connected, under what mechanisms/timescales they vary and how their circulation could be explained in the future.

## Supervision
I am interested in supervising students on interesting problems using ocean models as a heuristic for us to learn more about ocean ice-shelf interactions and ocean dynamics. Please get in touch if you are interested. Mechanisms include: the [ONE Planet Doctoral Training Partnership](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/research/postgraduate-research-degrees/studentships/one-planet-dtp/) and Northumbria University's internally funded program, both routes are possible for international students. We are also interested in enabling post-PhD research, for example we can support UKRI [FLF](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/developing-people-and-skills/future-leaders-fellowships/), Royal Society [URF](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/university-research/?gclid=CjwKCAjw_aemBhBLEiwAT98FMlwx57u_F2vkRNpCoutwAYOA1FbkHa8mwd4zui3icD4Fxm7RJjgephoC8lUQAvD_BwE) and [IRF](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/developing-people-and-skills/nerc/nerc-fellowships/) programs.

Past experience: Jing Jin completed her PhD ("Modelling the Amery Ice Shelf") in May 2023. Affiliation: School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol.
